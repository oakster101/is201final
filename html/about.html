                        <h2>I Love Shoes</h2>
                        <p>Do you know that a pair of Nike Air Mags, one of the rarest sneakers in the world, will cost you anywhere from 30-40 thousand dollars? To some people shoes are just an article of clothing to protect their feet and they cannot wrap their minds around why someone would pay so much money for a pair of shoes, but others realize that it is much more than just a pair of shoes. Shoes are so captivating to me because every shoe is unique- each with a completely different supply and demand, color scheme, design, and comfort level. Some people camp out for days outside of companies like adidas, nike, and footlocker just to get a sneaker that may only release once in their lifetime. Other people like me who don’t live in a big city have to wait online for a chance to purchase these coveted shoes. Most hyped shoes will sell out online anywhere from 3-15 seconds, so it is usually really stressful especially when the site crashes or the payment information won’t go through. I have been a Sneakerhead (someone who buys, collects, and sells rare sneakers) for about a year and a half now. In the last year I have sold around $2,000 worth of shoes online, but some people resell sneakers for a career.</p>
                        <p>In order to stay informed about new drops and releases I follow about 10 different Instagram accounts that post the retail prices for new shoes, the dates they will release, and the estimated resell prices. I am also subscribed to roughly 20 different sneaker email newsletters so I never miss a hyped release. Some releases are not very publicized so it is important to always stay ahead of the game and always have a plan.  I have also made friends who obsess over shoes as much as me and we get together at lunch and we talk about upcoming releases or how we are going to afford a pair of $300 Jordans that we want for our collection. Being a Sneakerhead takes a lot of time and effort but when you score a pair of Yeezys or make a sneaker sale for $500 it makes it all worth it. </p>
